Description: 
        A package to represent adn solve Kakuro puzzles. Puzzles are input as two
        dimensional arrays of either Blank objects (entries to be filled in or that are
        already filled in with a value) or Block objects (greyed out entries, possibly
        specifying a vertical and / or horizontal sum).
        
        The package uses an iterative process to refine the board, and backtracking by
        branching on an entry with the fewest number of possible values when refinement
        fails to make any progress.
        
        A generator is used to provide solutions in the case of boards with no solutions
        or ambiguous boards with multiple solutions.
